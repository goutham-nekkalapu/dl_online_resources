## About:
This directory has all the notebooks used in the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/), an awesome course offered by [fast.ai](fast.ai), taught by "Jermey Howard". 

### Description:

#### Deeplearning part-1:
The files under "deeplearning1/fastai_files" are the the original course notebooks which use Python2,  Keras 1.2.0 and Theano as a backend for Keras. 

But those codes are modified as "deeplearning1/tf_keras_2", which support:
- Python3, 
- Keras 2.0 
- Tensorflow 1.10 as backend for Keras.

#### Deeplearning part-2:
Part-2 uses the following:

- Python3, 
- Keras 2.0 
- Tensorflow 1.10 as backend for Keras.
